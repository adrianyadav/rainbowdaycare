# Rainbow Colours Family Day Care — Website

A small business website I built for **Rainbow Colours Family Day Care** (Bardia, NSW).  
It’s designed to give parents a quick overview of the service and make it easy to enquire.

**Live site:** https://rainbowcoloursfamilydaycare.com.au/

## What I built
- **Marketing pages:** Home, About, Activities, Food, Gallery
- **Lead capture:** Contact / Enquiry form + click-to-call and email links
- **Mobile-first layout:** Clean, simple structure for parents browsing on phones
- **Content that converts:** Clear opening hours, location, and availability shown upfront

## Key sections
- **Home:** overview + availability + hours
- **About:** educator/service info
- **Activities:** daily/weekly activities and outings
- **Food:** what’s provided vs what families bring
- **Gallery:** photos
- **Contact:** enquiry form + details

## Result
A straightforward, parent-friendly website that communicates essentials fast and drives enquiries.

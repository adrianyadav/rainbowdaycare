      0 to 5 yrs is an important foundation age for children. They need to
      feel good about themselves and the people they are surrounded with. I lead
      them gently so they pick up a routine and learn to be helpful and kind.

      I also spot their strengths and encourage them in that direction.
      Children feel supported, and then they get ready for school life"

      \r- Painting\r

      \r

      - Yoga \r

      Art and games encourage youngsters to examine creativity more
      deeply, think about it, and discuss it. They provide a framework for
      faculties to build on children's observations, understandings, and
      discussions about creativity."

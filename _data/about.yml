      I offer a safe environment for children, to be themselves, to explore, to
      get positive strokes.


      0 to 5 yrs is an important foundation age for children. They need to feel good about themselves and the people they are surrounded with. I lead them gently so they pick up a routine and learn to be helpful and kind.


      I also spot their strengths and encourage them in that direction. Children feel supported, and then they get ready for school life.

      At our family daycare, our kids engage in a various range of activities:


      - Painting

      - Yoga 

      - Dancing 

      - Weekly excursions (to a nearby park) 

      - Games  


      Art and games encourage youngsters to examine creativity more deeply, think about it, and discuss it. They provide a framework for faculties to build on children's observations, understandings, and discussions about creativity.

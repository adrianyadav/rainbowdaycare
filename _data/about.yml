      I offer a safe environment for children, to be themselves, to explore, to
      get positive strokes.


      0 to 5 yrs is an important foundation age for children. They need to feel good about themselves and the people they are surrounded with. I lead them gently so they pick up a routine and learn to be helpful and kind.


      I also spot their strengths and encourage them in that direction. Children feel supported, and then they get ready for school life.
